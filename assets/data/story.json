    "My Premii, my Pakhiii, my Bibijan, my dear Purnimar Chadh 🌙, today marks 6 months of us. A long-distance love stronger than 190 km, stronger than time.",
    "We started as friends…\"We were friends first that's why we became everything to each other.\"",
    "17 June 2025, the day our hearts officially joined.",
    "Four months of long distance couldn't keep us apart. December 7-9, 2025, three magical days when we reunited. Your gentle hand, our laughter playing badminton, fuska at Nilkhet, and Tasty Treat moments. You didn't let me go to Cumilla, and I'm grateful for every extra second with you.",
    "You are my: Sweetheart, Golappp, Bou, Valobashaa, Dreamy, Happiness, Queen, Purnimar Chadh. And I am your: My Dear Husband, Jamai, Baby, Idiot.",
    "Six months with you feels like six chapters of infinity. And I want the whole book with only you."
